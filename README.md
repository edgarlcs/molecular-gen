Molecular generation survey 

Here is the Notebook used to do the experiments on the different algorithms.  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KI5IDLtW0Ctrp04MTnAcB0zoViIUWGEO?usp=sharing

None of the files are saved since Colab deletes them after a few hours so you have to run all the cells and train again to obtain the results. 

#######Instructions#######

1. Open notebook with colab 
2. Change runtime type to GPU
3. Run all the cells and begin training
4. Enjoy!
